# javascript-workshop
This is a Javascript Workshop repository that I have created during my time as a Mentor at DevMountain to help instruct students and further their understanding about the core concepts and behaviours of Javascript.

This workshop repository was inspired by [AirBnB's Javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#types)
